      <p> It's been 21 years since the death of Nigerian military ruler Sani Abacha. He ruled Nigeria with an iron grip and his regime was marred by gross human rights abuses. Abacha remains a divisive figure in his home country.

             <li><strong>1983</strong> - Enters national spotlight because of his role in the 31 December coup that toppled the civilian government of President Shehu Shagari. Gen Muhammadu Buhari is installed as military ruler.

             <li><strong>June 1998</strong> - Abacha dies from a suspected heart attack and is buried the same day. Nigeria transitions to democratic rule one year later.</li>
      </ul>
